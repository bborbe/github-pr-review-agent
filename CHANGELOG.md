# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v0.6.9

- chore: update github.com/bborbe/agent to v0.87.0, github.com/bborbe/vault-cli to v0.121.3

## v0.6.8

- chore: update github.com/bborbe/agent to v0.86.0, github.com/bborbe/argument/v2 to v2.13.2, github.com/bborbe/cqrs to v0.6.10, github.com/bborbe/errors to v1.6.0, github.com/bborbe/kafka to v1.25.11, github.com/bborbe/maintainer to v0.50.5, github.com/bborbe/sentry to v1.10.1, github.com/bborbe/service to v1.10.11, github.com/bborbe/time to v1.27.12, github.com/bborbe/vault-cli to v0.121.2, github.com/onsi/gomega to v1.43.0

## v0.6.7

- fix: tier-key the `HasUnverifiedConcerns` fail-close gate — a `not-verified` concern now fail-closes an `approve` only when it is a MUST-tier blocker or a bare unexamined admission; a benign explained concern (e.g. "Go 1.27 toolchain not available in the review sandbox; CI precommit is the gate") passes, so a clean approve can no longer post a false `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (observed 2026-09-01 Seibert-Data/quickbooks#4 on the octopus fleet). The verdict-schema prompt (`execution_output-format.md`) mirrors the rule: examined-but-toolchain-limited concerns are `not-an-issue` with the verifier named in `detail`

## v0.6.6

- fix: make the `concerns_addressed` disposition a structured field (`addressed` | `not-an-issue` | `not-verified`) and read it directly in `HasUnverifiedConcerns` — an `approve` whose concerns were all examined now posts as `APPROVED` no matter how the model worded its explanations, ending the recurring false `CHANGES_REQUESTED` on clean approves (observed 2026-08-24 bborbe/nuke#68 and 2026-08-30 bborbe/discord-assistant#37); legacy bare-string entries still demote on a `not verified` substring

## v0.6.5

- fix: resolve the ai_review PR URL with `ExtractPRURL` (searches pre-H2 sections) instead of a bare preamble match, and skip the inline diff instead of failing when no URL is found — v0.6.4 swapped the old "gh is not available" false-fail for `ai_review: no GitHub PR URL in preamble — cannot fetch diff`, which failed every run whose task carried the URL outside the preamble (observed on dev, bborbe/go-skeleton#98). Missing URL is now a skip, mirroring `callVerifier` and the dismiss path; a diff-fetch error stays fail-closed

## v0.6.4

- fix: ai_review verifier now verifies hallucinated citations against the PR raw diff embedded inline in the verifier preamble (host-fetched via `gh pr diff`, supplied under `## Environment` as `PR Diff` + `Posted Review Comments`) instead of a model-run `gh pr diff` shell-out — the false "gh is not available" failure disappears and the check always has real ground truth — and the ai_review tool allowlist drops its `gh pr` Bash entries (reviewTools is now `Read`/`Grep` only)
- test: regression-lock the ai_review verifier inline-diff behavior — Ginkgo rows assert the diff + posted review comments reach the verifier prompt, a sound review passes without `human_review` escalation, and a fabricated citation still fails with the hallucination naming the fabricated comment (`pkg/steps_review_test.go`); the `ReviewTools` allowlist test locks `Read`/`Grep` only (`pkg/factory`); `PRDiff` subprocess tests cover the shell-out + error surface (`pkg/github/client_test.go`)

## v0.6.3

- fix: key the `HasUnverifiedConcerns` fail-close on the concern's own blocker tiering (MUST-tier "must verify" / "will never fire" / "blocking" language, or a bare unexamined admission) instead of a benign-phrase whitelist — a benign "not verified (could not be cross-checked — source not in this repository)" note no longer demotes a clean `approve` to `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (false-request-changes recurrence 2026-08-24, bborbe/nuke#68, on v0.6.2; re-review posted APPROVED 5 min later)

## v0.6.2

- fix: narrow the `HasUnverifiedConcerns` fail-close to genuinely-unexamined MUST-tier concerns — a benign "not verified (… not applicable …)" note (config/docs-only change, no code to verify) no longer demotes a clean `approve` to `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (false-request-changes regression 2026-08-23, bborbe/math#18, admin-merged)

## v0.6.1

- chore: update Go to 1.27.0 and github.com/bborbe/agent to v0.82.1, github.com/bborbe/cqrs to v0.6.8, github.com/bborbe/errors to v1.5.20, github.com/bborbe/kafka to v1.25.9, github.com/bborbe/maintainer to v0.50.0, github.com/bborbe/sentry to v1.9.26, github.com/bborbe/service to v1.10.9, github.com/bborbe/time to v1.27.10, github.com/bborbe/vault-cli to v0.114.6

## v0.4.6

- chore: Fix `make precommit` on the Go 1.27 toolchain — run `gofmt -w` last in the `format` target (after golines) so its wrapping is normalized before the gofmt lint check, and bump `GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION` v2.12.2 → v2.13.1 (fixes staticcheck `buildir` panic on Go 1.27 AST) + `ERRCHECK_VERSION` v1.10.0 → v1.20.0 (fixes `package "context" without types`) in `tools.env`

## v0.4.5

- fix: require verification of funnel findings against the actual worktree file before reporting (execution-phase prompt no longer treats over-inclusive mechanical findings as pre-confirmed)

## v0.4.4

- chore: update dependencies

## v0.4.3

- fix: allow read-only `git -C <workdir>` forms (`diff`, `log`, `show`, `status`, `ls-files`, `fetch`, `worktree`, `branch`, `rev-parse`) in the execution-phase allowlist (`pkg/factory`) so reviews that target the worktree with `-C` no longer die on `permission_denied`, and steer the execution prompt (`pkg/prompts`) to run plain `git` from the worktree cwd

## v0.4.2

- chore: bump Go 1.26.5 → 1.26.6 and update all dependencies

## v0.4.1

- chore: rebuild to pick up `bborbe/coding` v0.42.3, which gates the two `go-licensing` MUST rules on real repo visibility. The plugin is baked at image build time and frozen for the life of the tag (see `.chart-maintainer` spec 054), so a plugin fix only reaches the reviewer through a new agent image — no code change here, the rebuild *is* the delivery mechanism. Without it the bot keeps emitting `go-licensing/license-file-required` on private repos: 69 of 73 non-archived `Seibert-Data` repos carry no LICENSE by design, and one PR had to be admin-merged to get past the false positive.

## v0.4.0

- fix: bump `github.com/klauspost/compress` v1.18.6 → v1.18.7 (GO-2026-5841, out-of-bounds read in `compress/s2`). `make vulncheck` failed on master, which blocked the dark-factory preflight baseline.
- feat: add `--skip-post` flag to `cmd/run-task` that suppresses all GitHub write calls, allowing safe local review runs against third-party PRs. Findings are still written to the task file. Also adds the required nil-poster guard in `pkg/steps_review.go`'s `tryDismissHallucinated` and corrects mis-attributed CLI documentation in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/pr-post-back.md`.

## v0.3.6

- fix: code-level fail-closed gate on the funnel-failed path. When the Go-side mechanical funnel could not run (`funnel.Ran == false`) and the review model still returns `approve`, `postAndRoute` now overrides the verdict to `request-changes` (reason `mechanical funnel did not run`, recognised by `isFailClosedReason`) instead of trusting the prompt-only "you MUST NOT approve" instruction — which leaned on the same weak model this fix exists to work around. Mirrors the existing unparseable-verdict fail-close. `funnel.Ran` is threaded through `runClaude` → `postAndRoute`; tests cover both directions (funnelRan=false approve→request-changes, funnelRan=true approve preserved).

## v0.3.5

- fix: run the ast-grep mechanical funnel in the agent (Go) and inject its findings into the execution prompt, instead of steering the review model to invoke the runner. The execution prompt prescribed `ast-grep-runner.sh … > /tmp/pr-review-findings.json` — but that `>` redirect (plus the model's own `; echo EXIT:$?` and `bash -c '…'` wrappers) makes a compound command the `Bash(runner.sh:*)` allowlist entry can never match, so every runner call was denied. A weak model (MiniMax-M2.7, quant dev+prod) then concluded "funnel unavailable" and silently did a judgment-only review — dropping the entire MUST-tier mechanical pass on every PR, invisibly. Reproduced on quant dev (go-skeleton#58): runner ground truth was 6 findings; the bot posted a judgment-only review sourced from code comments, not the runner. New `pkg.FunnelRunner` diff-scopes to the PR's changed files and execs the runner deterministically; `BuildExecutionInstructions` injects the authoritative JSON (model must consume, not re-run) or, on funnel failure, a fail-closed status that forbids a silent `approve`. The runner path is removed from `factory.executionTools` (the model no longer invokes it — smaller attack surface). Because the injected findings carry PR-author-controlled strings (matched text from the diff), the runner output is validated as well-formed JSON (fail-closed on garbage / a compromised runner) and any markdown code-fence sequence is neutralised before embedding, so a crafted PR cannot break out of the prompt's ```json block and inject directives. Fixes the bypass model-independently (M2.7 or M3).

## v0.3.4

- fix: extract the verdict JSON by ```json fence boundaries instead of byte-level brace matching. `findLastJSONVerdictBlock` walked braces without string-awareness, so a stray brace or unescaped quote inside a JSON string *value* — common when the review prose describes parser code — mis-extracted the block, failed `json.Unmarshal`, and fail-closed an `approve` verdict to `request-changes` → GitHub state `CHANGES_REQUESTED` → blocked auto-merge and forced admin overrides. Observed on bborbe/github-update-go-agent#5 (valid JSON, a lone `'}'` in a string fooled the brace walker into grabbing prose) and #3 (unescaped inner `"` made the fenced block invalid JSON). New `findFencedJSONVerdictBlock` extracts the last ```json fenced block containing a `verdict` field (fence-delimited → immune to braces/quotes in string values); the brace walk survives only as a fallback for bare, unfenced JSON. When a fenced block is still invalid JSON, `recoverFencedVerdict` reads the literal `verdict` field verbatim — it can surface only the value the model actually wrote, never invent one, so it cannot flip a genuine `request-changes` to `approve`. Regression fixtures are the real #3/#5/#6 review bodies captured from the GitHub API (`pkg/testdata/`). The counter-example #6 (Dockerfile review, no braces/quotes in string values) already worked and stays `approve`.

## v0.3.3

- fix: install `python3` and `jq` in the Dockerfile alpine stage so the ast-grep mechanical funnel (`scripts/ast-grep-runner.sh`, Step 4a of `/coding:pr-review`) can run. The image shipped `ast-grep` but neither `python3` (the runner shells `python3 -c` for millisecond timestamps at lines 82/254, unconditionally under `set -euo pipefail`) nor `jq` (used throughout for JSON assembly) — so the runner died at line 82 with `python3: command not found` (exit 127) before any scan, silently skipping the entire MUST-tier mechanical rule pass on every review while judgment-tier coverage still completed. Reproduced end-to-end in an alpine:3.23 container mirroring the image packages: current state → exit 127, zero findings; `+python3 +jq` → exit 0, 66 YAMLs run, real MUST findings, `errors: []`. Surfaced on octopus dev during v0.3.2 selector-allowlist verification (`Seibert-Data/test-dev#1`).

## v0.3.2

- fix: restore real reviews under selector mode. The `/coding:pr-review` default dispatcher switched to selector mode (in-session classify+adjudicate, zero sub-agent spawns) in coding v0.22.0; the execution-phase `--allowedTools` allowlist (`factory.executionTools`) still assumed the old per-owner-dispatch model (`Task` + git only), so the review could not `Read` files, run the ast-grep mechanical funnel, or shell `jq`/`git rev-parse` — and the non-interactive container stalled, posting "I need your approval to proceed" as the review with a false `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. Expand `executionTools` with `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`, `Bash(git rev-parse:*)`, `Bash(command -v:*)`, `Bash(jq:*)`, and the ast-grep runner's literal container path — all read-only, no network tools, so the anti-injection boundary holds. The assembled execution header now steers the model to invoke the runner/guide by literal path instead of the plugin's `$RUNNER`/`$GUIDE` shell variable (which an allowlist entry cannot match).

## v0.3.1

- fix(security): bump `golang.org/x/text` v0.38.0 → v0.40.0 to clear CVE-2026-56852 (infinite loop on invalid input) and restore a green `make precommit` baseline.

## v0.3.0

- feat: add `pr-override` task type. A trusted-author PR carrying the `override-review` label (emitted by github-pr-watcher) routes to a new code-only, single-phase override agent that posts an `APPROVE` at the PR head SHA via the new `PrPoster.PostOverrideApprove` — a fresh bot APPROVE supersedes the bot's own false-positive `CHANGES_REQUESTED` for reviewDecision, so any write-access user can merge without admin. No Claude, no clone, no container. CI status checks still apply (the label clears only the review requirement). Registered as a second task type in `CreateAgentProvider` alongside `pr-review` + `healthcheck`; `PostOverrideApprove` posts unconditionally (no autoApprove gate, no WorkDir, no prior-review dismissal), mirroring `PostLGTM`.

## v0.2.0

- fix: remove the planning-phase "no concerns → LGTM" shortcut. Planning is now pure triage: every GitHub PR advances to the execution phase for a real (checkout + deep) review that posts an earned `APPROVE`/`REQUEST_CHANGES` verdict. Previously a shallow planning pass with empty concerns posted a `COMMENT` "no concerns flagged" review without ever running the real review — a rubber-stamp that also failed to satisfy a required-approving-review merge gate (a COMMENT is not an approval). Tasks with no GitHub PR URL now escalate to `human_review` (subsumes the old non-GitHub-platform terminal case) instead of posting an LGTM. Removed the now-dead `postLGTMAndDone`/`handleEmptyPRURL`/`isGitHubPRURL`/`hasAnyPRURL`/`writePlanningVerdict` planning helpers and simplified `NewPlanningStep` (no longer takes a poster/botLogin/clock). `PrPoster.PostLGTM` is retained but deprecated.

## v0.1.3

- fix: planning-step JSON parser now tolerates conversational prose around the `## Plan` block. `parsePlanningConcerns` previously only stripped ```json fences at the very start, so any model that narrates before the fence (DeepSeek/vLLM emits e.g. "Now I have the full picture…") produced `invalid character 'N'`, failed 3× retries, and marked the review task `failed` with no verdict posted. New `extractJSONObject` locates the JSON via the first ```json/``` fenced block, else the first `{`…last `}` span. Unblocks real-diff reviews on non-Anthropic endpoints (real Anthropic emits clean JSON, so this was latent on quant).

## v0.1.2

- fix: forward `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU,FABLE}_MODEL` (new `--anthropic-default-*-model` args / env) into the claude subprocess env, so spawned review sub-agents (which request opus/sonnet/haiku) resolve to the configured model instead of the default `claude-sonnet-*`. Needed against non-Anthropic endpoints (DeepSeek/vLLM) where the default aliases 404 — the top-level `--model` worked but sub-agents crashed. Empty = unset (no-op on Anthropic).
- chore: bump Go 1.26.4 → 1.26.5 (GO-2026-5856); ignore unmaintained-openpgp GO-2026-5932 in `VULNCHECK_IGNORE` + `.trivyignore`.

## v0.1.1

- refactor: import the shared library from its new root module path `github.com/bborbe/maintainer` (was `github.com/bborbe/maintainer/lib`) and bump to `@v0.45.0`. The maintainer repo flattened `lib/` to its root to match the `bborbe/agent` layout. No behavior change.

## v0.1.0

- Extracted from the `bborbe/maintainer` monorepo (`agent/pr-reviewer`) into a
  standalone publish-only repository. The shared code now comes from the versioned
  `github.com/bborbe/maintainer/lib` module instead of a local `replace`. Builds and
  publishes `docker.io/bborbe/github-pr-review-agent:<version>` via `make buca`.
