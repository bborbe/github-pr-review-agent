# Releasing github-pr-review-agent

How to ship a new version of the PR review agent. Read before any manual release step.

## One surface, one version stream

This repo ships a **single artifact**: the container image
`docker.io/bborbe/github-pr-review-agent:vX.Y.Z`, versioned by the git tag `vX.Y.Z`
and the matching `## vX.Y.Z` section in `CHANGELOG.md`. There is **no plugin**, no
`.claude-plugin/`, no marketplace, no version-alignment across manifests. The tag is
the version; the image build pins to it.

## Binary/image release — driver: github-releaser-agent (post-merge)

`.dark-factory.yaml` sets `autoRelease: false`, so the dark-factory daemon never tags on
a feature branch. `.maintainer.yaml` has `release.autoRelease: true`, so the **only**
release driver is the maintainer bot (the sibling `github-releaser-agent`), post-merge:

1. You land commits on `master` carrying `## Unreleased` bullets in `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. The releaser classifies the semver bump (`feat:` → minor, `fix:` → patch, breaking → major).
3. It rewrites `## Unreleased` → `## vX.Y.Z`, commits `release vX.Y.Z`, tags, pushes to `master`.

Picks up within ~10 min of the merge. Force an immediate scan with
`/github-release-repo-trigger` (no arg — global scan).

**Your job in this flow:** keep `## Unreleased` bullets accurate, merge to master.
**Do NOT** rename `## Unreleased` → `## vX.Y.Z`, **do NOT** create a local tag — that
races the bot. A breaking-change bullet classifies as `major`; without
`release.allowMajorBump: true` the release escalates to `human_review` instead of
cutting a major (that is why a merged PR can produce no tag).

## Verifying a release shipped

```bash
git fetch --tags
git describe --tags --abbrev=0                                # latest tag
git log "$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)"..HEAD --oneline   # any commits beyond it
```

After a successful release both `git status` (clean) and
`git rev-list @{u}..HEAD --count` (zero) should hold.

## Deploy (image → cluster)

The tag alone does not deploy anything. This is a **mirrored agent service** in the
`bborbe` fleet; the shared lib + Helm chart live in
[`bborbe/maintainer`](https://github.com/bborbe/maintainer), and the running agent is
spawned by the agent-task-executor from a Kafka PR-review task.

```bash
VERSION=vX.Y.Z make buca   # build + push docker.io/bborbe/github-pr-review-agent:vX.Y.Z, then apply
```

Deploy specifics — both version sources live in `~/Documents/workspaces/nuke/github-pr-reviewer/`:
(1) `values-dev.yaml` and `values-prod.yaml` — the `agent.tag` field in each;
(2) `Makefile` — the `AGENT_TAG_dev` and `AGENT_TAG_prod` variables. Bump BOTH sources
in lockstep on every deploy, then mirror + apply dev first, then prod:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/workspaces/nuke/github-pr-reviewer
BRANCH=dev make mirror && BRANCH=dev make apply
BRANCH=master make mirror && BRANCH=master make apply
```

**Prod is `BRANCH=master`, not `BRANCH=prod`.** Using `BRANCH=prod` silently targets
the wrong channel.

## GitHub Release (optional milestone)

The `vX.Y.Z` tag is sufficient for image builds and `git describe`. A **GitHub Release**
is a separate, deliberate act — create one only to surface a milestone:

```bash
TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
gh release create "$TAG" --target master --title "$TAG" \
  --notes "$(awk "/^## $TAG/,/^## v/" CHANGELOG.md | head -n -1)"
```
