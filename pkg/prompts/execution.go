// funnelInjectSteerTemplate is prepended to the inlined /coding:pr-review
// procedure when the agent has ALREADY run the mechanical funnel (the normal
// path). The review runs non-interactively under a fixed --allowedTools
// allowlist (see factory.executionTools); the funnel runner is deliberately NOT
// on it — a weak model wraps the invocation in forms the allowlist can't match
// (`> redirect`, `bash -c`, `$RUNNER`), gets denied, and silently drops the
// mechanical MUST-tier pass. So the agent runs the funnel in Go and injects its
// JSON here; the model must consume it, not re-run the runner.
//
// IMPORTANT (2026-08-19, github-pr-reviewer false-positive incident): the
// funnel output is deliberately OVER-INCLUSIVE — several rules (main-test-with-
// compiles, secret-fields-need-display-length, slog-not-glog-in-new-projects,
// external-call-logs-response, counterfeiter-directive-on-interface) fire on
// every candidate and rely on the adjudicator to confirm the actual condition
// (file exists, tag present, directive present, project age). Earlier wording
// ("treat every finding as a confirmed MUST-tier finding, do NOT second-guess")
// suppressed that adjudication and caused present code to be re-reported as
// missing every round. The model MUST verify each finding against the actual
// file content in the worktree before reporting it; findings it cannot confirm
// are dropped, not escalated.
// %[1]s = plugin root, %[2]s = funnel findings JSON.
